Morbid is a Twisted-based publish/subscribe messaging server that uses the
STOMP protocol. To use Morbid, run python setup.py install; then type morbid.
For additional help, use morbid -h.

It is named Morbid because it is a sin against humanity. Whoever writes new MQs
without good reason should be shot. Morbid exists only to provide basic
publish/subscribe functionality to orbited users that don't know how to
download and start a real message queue. For some reason, no one likes the
idea of doing anything in a reasonable, coherent way with more than one 
process, ever.

If you want a real message queue that speaks STOMP (or some almost-STOMP) then
check out RabbitMQ (www.rabbitmq.com) or ActiveMQ (http://activemq.apache.org/)

If you want to extend this server in some way for some reason, then feel free;
just email the Orbited mailing list (orbited-users@groups.google.com) with your
patches. If this happens a lot, I'll create a mailing list and make the 
repoistory public.
